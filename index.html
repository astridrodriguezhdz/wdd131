            <section class="about_me_p">
                <p>Hi, I'm Astrid Rodríguez. I'm from Mexico and I've lived in Mexico
                    City all my life. It's funny because I have access to so many
                    different attractions. If you decide to visit Mexico City, my
                    recommendation is: Don't forget to eat a "Torta de tamal", which is so
                    delicious. I love to dance, sing, and play the piano, and I'm so
                    excited to start this Software Development path. I have previous
                    elemental programming knowledge, and I have enjoyed every moment in
                    front of my code screen. I hope each one of us can increase our
                    programming abilities by doing our best during this course. Nice to
                    meet you and, have a good day!</p>

                <h2>Mexico City, Mexico</h2>
                <img src="images/mexico_flag.webp" alt="Image of the Mexican flag" class="float">
                <p>  Mexico City is a versatile place. If you're looking for fun and
                    extensive kinds of activities, Mexico City is the best option. The
                    legend says that our Mexicans' ancestors received a divine instruction
                    to settle where they find an eagle devouring a snake. They found it
                    and builded their civilization, even though it was over a lake. That's
                    why Mexico City was constructed in this place. If you visit my state,
                    you're going to find legends, history, art, recreational activities
                    and even an archaeological zone in the middle of the city. If you
                    come, don't forget to eat our famous tacos and elotes, or esquites.</p>
